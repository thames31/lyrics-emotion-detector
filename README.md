# Information 

This project's initial goal is to build a recommendation system that will select the top 5 songs similar to an inputted song. Because sometimes we get bored of listening to the same one song that we love. In order to prevent such tragedy from happening, we should listen to other songs that are similar to our beloved song.

The dataset that we will be using is from Spotify but can be download from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/audio-features-and-lyrics-of-spotify-songs). It contains over 18000 Spotify songs along with musical features. However, this project will only use lyrical content of each songs in English. Maybe one day songs of other languages can be incorporated into our recommendation system.
