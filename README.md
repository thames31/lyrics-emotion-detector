# Information 

This project's initial goal is to build a model that can recommend you a song based on the kind of emotion conveyed through the lyrics. If you are ever feeling a certain emotion and would like to compliment that feeling with music, then you should use this recommendation system.

The dataset that we will be using is from Spotify but can be download from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/audio-features-and-lyrics-of-spotify-songs). It contains over 18000 Spotify songs along with musical features. However, this project will only use lyrical content of each songs in English. Maybe one day songs of other languages can be incorporated into our recommendation system.
